1. Finding no. of digits in a no. 

	a. Simple Solution: O(digitsCount). A Simple Solution that comes in mind is:

Check if the number N is not equals to zero.
Increase the count of digits by 1 if N is not zero.
Reduce the number by dividing it by 10.
Repeat the above steps until the number is reduced to zero.

	b. Formula: O(1)

number of digits in N = floor(log10(N) + 1)


2. AP , GP:

	a. AP
nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d.
Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP.
Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ].

	b. GP
a (n)= a (1)* r^(n-1)

nth term of a GP = a*r^(n-1.)
Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP.
Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (r^n – 1)] / [r – 1].
Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).


3. Quadratic eqn 

roots = (-b ± v(b2 - 4ac))/2a

4. Mean , Median

There are other types of means. Geometric mean, Harmonic mean and Arithmetic mean.
Mean is the only measure of central tendency where the sum of the deviations of each value from the mean is always zero.

Formula for finding Median :

If the count of numbers is odd: After sorting the sequence,
Median = {(N+1)/2}th value.
If the count of numbers is even: After sorting the sequence,
Median  =  Average of (N/2)th and {(N/2) + 1}th value.

Facts about Median :

Median is an important measure (compared to mean) for distorted data, because median is not so easily distorted. For example, median of {1, 2, 2, 5, 100) is 2 and mean is 22.
If the user adds a constant to every value, the mean and median increases by the same constant.
If the user multiplies every value by a constant, the mean and the median will also be multiplied by that constant.

5.Primes -having divisor between 2 to n-1

Sieve of Eratosthenes

Using Sieve of Eratosthenes is the most efficient way of generating prime numbers upto a given number N.

Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:
Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.

6. LCM HCF/GCD

Basic Euclidean Algorithm for HCF
The Euclidean algorithm is based on the below facts:
If we subtract the smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesn't change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when the remainder is found to be 0.

gcd(a, b)
{
    if (a == 0)
        return b;

    return gcd(b % a, a);
}

O(log(min(a, b)))


Important properties of LCM and HCF:

For two numbers say, 'a' and 'b', LCM x HCF = a x b.
HCF of co-primes = 1.
For two fractions,
HCF = HCF (Numerators) / LCM (Denominators)
LCM = LCM (Numerators) / HCF (Denominators)

7. Factorial

Trailing 0s in N! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!
                  = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....

8. Permutation:

n Pr = n! / (n - r)!
n P n = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*......*1 = n!
n P 0 = n! / n! = 1
n P 1 = n
n P n-1 = n!
n P r/n P r-1 = n - r + 1

Permutation with repetition allowed: The number of permutation or arrangements of N numbers with repetition allowed will be N^N. For Example, permutaions of {1,2} with repetitions will be {{1,1}, {1,2}, {2,1},{2,2}}.

Permutation with duplicates: The number of permutations or arrangements of N objects of which p1 are of one kind, p2 are of second kind, ..., pk are of k-th kind and the rest if any, are of different kinds is: N! / (p1! * p2! *....*pk!).


9. Combination:

n C r = n! / [ (r !) * (n - r)! ]
Important Properties of Combination:
n C 0 = n C n = 1.
n C r = n C n-r.
n C r + n C r-1 = n+1 C r.
n * (n-1 C r-1) = (n - r + 1)*( n C r-1).

10. Modular Arithmetic

(a + b) mod M = ((a mod M) + (b mod M)) mod M.
(a - b) mod M = ((a mod M) - (b mod M)) mod M.
(a * b) mod M = ((a mod M) * (b mod M)) mod M.

Not for Division

Modular Inverse

The modular inverse is an integer 'x' such that.
 a x = 1 (mod M) 

The value of x should be in {0, 1, 2, ... M-1}, i.e., in the ring of integer modulo M.

The multiplicative inverse of "a modulo M" exists if and only if a and M are relatively prime (i.e., if gcd(a, M) = 1).

Methods of finding Modular Inverse:

a. Extended Euclidean Algorithm: This method can be used when a and M are co-prime.

takes two integers 'a' and 'b', finds their gcd and also find 'x' and 'y' such that,
 ax + by = gcd(a, b) 

To find modulo inverse of 'a' under 'M', we put b = M in the above formula. Since we know that a and M are relatively prime, we can put value of gcd as 1.

So, the formula becomes:
ax + My = 1 

If we take modulo M on both sides, we get:
ax + My = 1 (mod M)


b. Fermat Little Theorem: This method can be used when M is prime.

if M is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number aM – a is an integer multiple of M.

That is,
aM = a (mod M).

Since, a and M are co-prime to each other then aM-1 is an integral multiple of M.
That is,
aM-1 = 1 (mod M)
If we multiply both sides by a-1, we get:
a^(-1) = a^(M-2) mod M

Therefore, if M is a prime number to find modulo inverse of a under M, find modular exponentiation of aM-2 under modulo M.
